# Urban-AgTech-App

Deployed link (Work in progress): https://eddiephi.github.io/Urban-AgTech-App/

This is an application meant to facilitate the process of urban gardening and farmings for folks ranging between newcomers to seasoned pros. The app will include features to assist with choosing the right crop for the geographical location a user is in, assist with taking notes on specific crop data, provide realtime updates on real time weather changes, etc.

This app's initial development is happening during my time attending the Coding Bootcamp held at the University of New Hampshire.

Cheers to progress!
